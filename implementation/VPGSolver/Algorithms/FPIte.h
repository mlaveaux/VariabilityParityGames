/**
 * Implementation of the fixed-point iteration algorithm for parity games.
 *
 * The algorithm is modified to work more efficiently when for some vertices it is already known who the winner is. The
 * algorithm takes P0 and VP1 such that vertices in P0 are known to be won by player 0 and vertices not in VP1 are known
 * to be own by player 1. VP1 stands for V without P1. The algorithm calculates the winning set for player 0 (W0), we
 * know that P0 <= W0 <= VP1 (where <= is the standard subset or equal operation).
 *
 * The fixed-point variables are initialized such that least fixed-point variables start at P0 and greatest fixed-point
 * variables start at VP1. Furthermore we do not consider vertices in P0 or outside VP1 in the diamond box operation.
 *
 * When P0 = emptyset and VP1 = V then the algorithm behaves identical to the original fixed-point algorithm.
 *
 * When P0 and VP1 are incorrect then no guarantees are made by the algorithm.
 *
 * Finally, the algorithm assumes that vertices are sorted by parity first and priority second.
