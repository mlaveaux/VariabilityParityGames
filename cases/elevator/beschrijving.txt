Hier wat algemene beschrijvende tekst die ik bij elkaar heb geharkt:

The fPromela model extends the SMV models provided with the original paper in two ways. First, the 
number of floors (fixed at five by Plath and Ryan) is made variable. Second, three more features were
added to the system, giving a total of eight features. All features are independent, which means that 
there are 2^8 products.

The elevator system is comprised of a number of platform buttons and a number of cabin buttons. 
There is a single button on each platform, which calls the elevator. The button press is modelled 
non-deterministically, and a pressed button remains pressed until the elevator has served the floor 
and its doors are opened. The elevator will always serve all requests in its current direction before 
it stops and changes direction. When serving a floor, the lift doors open and close again. There are 
eight features that modify the behaviour of the lift. Those marked with an asterisk were added w.r.t.
Plath and Ryan.
 
- Empty: If the lift is empty, then all requests made in the cabin will be cancelled.
- Executive floor: One floor of the building has priority over the other floors and will be served first, 
   both for cabin and platform requests.
- *Open when idle: When idle, the lift opens its doors.
- Overload: The lift will refuse to close its doors when it is overloaded.
- Park: When idle, the lift returns to the first floor.
- *Quick close: The lift door cannot be kept open by holding the platform button pushed.
- *Shuttle: The lift will only change direction at the first and last floor.
- Two-thirds full: When the lift is two-thirds full, it will serve cabin calls before platform calls.
