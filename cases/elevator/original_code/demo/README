This directory contains all the files for the demonstration of SFI,
the SMV Feature Integrator, except for the binaries of SFI and SMV.
These can be found in the archive sfi-smv.tar.gz.

The subdirectories "lift/" and "phone/" contain the source files for
the case studies.

There is a useful script in "bin/bgsmv", and this should of course
be installed somewhere in your $PATH along with `sfi' and `smv'.
'bgsmv' invokes smv in the background and adds some admin info to 
the output. Invoke bgsmv without parameters for usage information.

The files distributed here should work fine with CMU SMV 2.4 and
higher.  The files will not work with Cadence SMV or with NuSMV.  (The
latter only requires syntactic changes - NuSMV doesn't accept the way
we use arrays.)

Please see the file "test/README" for details on how to test your
installation.
