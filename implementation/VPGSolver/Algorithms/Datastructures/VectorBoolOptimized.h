 * vector<bool> uses integers to efficiently represent many boolean variables.
 * boolean vectors can be used to represent sets, when performing set operation (e.g. union) then we do not want to
 * iterate all bools, we simply want to the perform bitwise and operator on the underlying integers.
 *
 * Also when we want to copy or compare parts of boolean vectors we want to do so by modifying/comparing the underlying
 * integers as opposed to the bools individually
 *
 * This class performs the operations above in an efficient manner.
 *
 * The C++ boost library should have been used for this.
