/**
 * Implementation of the recursive algorithm for VPGs.
 *
 * The algorithm allows for local solving vertex 0. The solvelocal property indicates that we can terminate early when
 * vertex 0 is won by player solvelocal. If solvelocal is -1 we are not allowed terminate early, if it is set to 2 we
 * are allowed to terminate when vertex 0 is found for either player 0 or 1.
 *
 * Sets of vertices with configurations are always represented by two variables; a vector containing a ConfSet for every
 * vertex and a vertexset such that every a vertex is in iff that vertex has a non-empty set of configurations.
 * The second variable is redundant but it allows to more conveniently check if the set of vertices is empty.
 * @todo: eveluate if using only a vector of configuration sets is more efficient.
 *
 * When solving globally solvelocal should be set to -1 initially.
 * Wehn solving locally solvelocal should be set to 2 initially.
