To test that everything is working as it should, run the following
commands on the files in this directory:

   sfi Exec-Sbcc.fsmv >! exec-sbcc.smv
   diff exec-sbcc.smv Exec-Sbcc.smv  # diff should not detect any changes
   bgsmv test.out exec-sbcc.smv
   diff test.out Test.out
        # diff should only detect changes in the first and last few lines

Should `sfi' or `smv' give errors, try recompiling from the sources.
 
If differences should occur, check whether they are more that
whitespace and linebreak.  If they should prove significant, something
is wrong, and recompiling will probably not help at all.
