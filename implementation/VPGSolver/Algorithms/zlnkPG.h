/**
 * Implementation of Zielonka's recursive algorithm.

 * The algorithm allows for local solving vertex 0. The solvelocal property indicates that we can terminate early when
 * vertex 0 is won by player solvelocal. If solvelocal is -1 we are not allowed terminate early, if it is set to 2 we
 * are allowed to terminate when vertex 0 is found for either player 0 or 1.
 *
 * When solving globally solvelocal should be set to -1 initially.
 * Wehn solving locally solvelocal should be set to 2 initially.
